Kay Moz Ceramics is the e-commerce website of artist Kay Moz(my wife). She designs, creates, and sells hand-thrown ceramics.

The website was built using WordPress and WooCommerce. I designed and built a custom theme for the UI, and developed a custom WordPress plugin for functionality specific to the needs of the site.
