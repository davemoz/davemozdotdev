This is a WIP project inspired by my endeavors in sourdough bread baking.

It is a web application for collecting baking recipes, and also provides useful tools such as timers (fermenting, proofing, baking, etc.) and converters.

It's early-days for this project, but this is a list of todos:

1. Setup user authentication and sessions
2. Allow users to save recipes to their account
3. Create baking timer

(I realize this is pretty much everything I claim the app to be. Several of these are currently actively being worked-on, so I'm hoping to have updates to this list soon.)
