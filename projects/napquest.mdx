## For parents who drive so their kids can sleep.

This is a WIP project for creating navigation routes based on total duration, rather than shortest time/distance.

I was inspired to create it while aimlessly driving my son around to fall asleep. Rather than guessing where(or how far) I would need to drive so he could sleep a certain amount, this app provides a similar interface to regular navigation apps, but provides a "Target duration" slider input, and then provides routes that match or closely match that target duration.

I completed some remaining todo items with the help of Google's Gemini 3 AI. It helped with creating waypoints along the obtained routes using [TurfJs](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf) and writing tests.
