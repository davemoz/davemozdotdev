## For parents who drive so their kids can sleep.

This is a WIP project for creating navigation routes based on total duration, rather than shortest time/distance.

I was inspired to create it while aimlessly driving my son around to fall asleep. Rather than guessing where, or how far I would need to drive so he could sleep a certain amount, this app provides a similar interface to regular navigation apps, but provides a "Total nap time" input, and then provides routes with that total duration.

Here's a list of some todos:

1. Finalize matrix of routes matching the "total nap time"
2. (Maybe) add actual "Start navigation" functionality
